# Cracking the Coding Interview in C#

1. [Chapter 01 | Arrays and Strings](#Chapter%2001%20|%20Arrays%20and%20Strings)

## Chapter 01 | Arrays and Strings

1. [Question 01](CTCI.Questions/Chapter01/Question01.cs) - Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you can not use additional data structures?
1. [Question 02](CTCI.Questions/Chapter01/Question02.cs) - Write code to reverse a C-Style String.
1. [Question 03](CTCI.Questions/Chapter01/Question03.cs) - Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional buffer.
1. [Question 04](CTCI.Questions/Chapter01/Question04.cs) - Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not.
1. [Question 05](CTCI.Questions/Chapter01/Question05.cs) - Write a method to replace all spaces in a strings with '%20'.
1. [Question 06](CTCI.Questions/Chapter01/Question06.cs) - Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees.
1. [Question 07](CTCI.Questions/Chapter01/Question07.cs) - Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column is set to 0.
1. [Question 08](CTCI.Questions/Chapter01/Question08.cs) - Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks is one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (i.e., "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat").
